# ci-build-simulator

This project can be used to seed a [Jenkins installation](https://github.com/robmoore-i/JenkinsEC2)
with a load of build data for use by my CodeDay team while they create a tool that a [Developer
Productivity Team](#appendix---developer-productivity) could use to view some basic analytics about their 
build.
